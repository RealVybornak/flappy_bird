## Description

Here goes the project description.

1. what purpose it serves

    For me it is a new thing to learn and how more programing works, learns me a lot of things. For others it is just a game they can play if they want.

2. how it works

    It is all run in python with the help of modules "random" and "pygame" I have constructed a code that is almost identical to the game Flappy bird expect this one acually goes on infinitly.

3. what are the main features

    Main features are just it works and break rarely. It has bad score tracker that i want to improve by making in-game counter for it to be nicer.

## How to install

_to be implemented later_

## How to Play

Game is simple and almost identical to the game Flappy bird. The game is played with just spacebar for now you can either click or you can hold the spacebar.

## Planned features

1. Textures

    Make so each thing in game has its own drawn sprite and not just a brick.

2. Score counter in game

    A counter that will let the player know how much points does he have.

3. Menu

    Menu in the beginning of the game. It should have settings play button. In setting just make it so you can turn on SFX and music.

4. Speed control

    Speed will increase by the amount of score.

5. Death screen

    When the player dies it will show a menu that will have few different features like "menu" button and "retry" button and more.

6. Spacebar can't be held

    Make so spacebar can't be held and make people break their spacebar.

7. Moving pipes

    At some threshold of points pipes will begin to move up and down.

8. Leaderboard

    Leaderboard would be nice doubt much players will be on there but it would be nice to see how is at the top. (seems hard tho)

9. MVC design

    Have no idea what this means but it sounds cool.

10. custom music

    maybe trying to add my own melody that i will play.

## Game parts
  1. Menu
      
      Menu is being worked on now so it has nice look and some meaning and mainly that it works. Have a setting button that will have just music setting. Also i might add the "Leaderboard" button where you can compare your highest score with others.

  2. Gameplay
      
      1. Bird

          One of the most important parts of the game is the bird by it self curently it is a nice yellow brick which i plan to change so it's nicer. Also i wanna try to make acurate hitboxes bit depends how hard it will be.
          
      2. pipes

          Pipes as of now just need textures and might add so they move up and down to up the difficulty, because who likes when things are too easy.
          But now i just wanna make sure they aren't giant green bricks and look pleasing. The design will be inspirated by pipes from Mario.
      
      3. Score system
        
          Curently the detection score system is nice but i would like a counter on top or bottom of the screen so player can see his score and doesn't he see it in Terminal after he dies

  3. Restart mechanism and death screen

      I want to have a death screen where it shows you your score and your highest score i have achived. "Retry" and "Menu" buttons so you can either go to the menu and quit or you can instantly restart without either going to the menu or turning the game off and just retry again.
